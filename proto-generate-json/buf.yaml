# A list of modules included in the local workspace. Each module
# defines the path to the directory where the Protobuf files are, and optionally
# its name (which corresponds a repository on the BSR), files or directories to
# exclude, and module-level lint and breaking change settings.
#
# Both the path and any includes/excludes fields are relative to the root of the workspace.
